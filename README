This is a fork of FAudio for the purpose of exploring an audio solution independent of the XAudio framework. Acknowledging the strengths of XAudio's design and FAudio's implementation, I'm left wanting FAudio to be a standalone solution for those with no interest in XAudio compatibility.

The development of this experimental library will for now be slow and periodic.

LabSound
    * Fork of WebKit's WebAudio implementation
    * Graphs galore

SoLoud
    * Easy to use. Not the best design for AAA games I hear (?)

OpenAL
    * Now you're old
    * Seems to be receiving lots of development recently at least

FAudio
    * What this project is forked from

Low-level (wrap the drivers / platform APIs):
    libsoundio
    PortAudio
    RtAudio
    miniaudio
    SDL

Platform APIs:
    Linux
        PulseAudio
        PipeWire
    Windows
        WASAPI

Platform APIs can be understood very simply:

They are userland daemons which receive audio samples from one or more sources,
mix them together, and send through the kernel to the appropriate hardware device.

This is no different from what applications do when mixing audio sources together.
The only difference is who the recipient of the output samples is.

Because the daemons are just userspace programs, multiple APIs can exist
on a platform. They just can't all be sending to the same hardware device
at the same time unless they are implemented by the same daemon, as often
is the case to maintain support for older APIs.

The story on Linux is that PulseAudio, an API and daemon, has
bad latency and so JACK thrives as an alternative among audiophiles.

For this library we're targeting consumers so we're targeting PulseAudio
on Linux, as well as PipeWire later which supposedly fixes the latency
issues and even implements the PulseAudio API for backwards compatibility.
