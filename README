This is a fork of FAudio for the purpose of exploring an audio solution independent of the XAudio framework. Acknowledging the strengths of XAudio's design and FAudio's implementation, I'm left wanting FAudio to be a standalone solution for those with no interest in XAudio compatibility.

The development of this experimental library will for now be slow and periodic.
